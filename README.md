# IP Database Filter Tool

This is a Python-based GUI tool that compares two excel files containing IP addresses:

- ✅ One file with **scanned or imported IPs** (possibly including new and existing entries)
- ✅ One file with **current IPs from your database**
- 📤 Then it **filters out only the new IPs** not yet present in your database
- 📁 Finally, it **exports the result to an Excel (.xlsx) file**

---

## 🔧 Features

- Compare scanned/imported IPs vs. database IPs
- Extract only the **new IPs** that need to be added
- Easy-to-use **GUI built with Tkinter**
- Reads from **PDF files**
- Exports results to an **Excel file**
- Simple and fast — no coding required by the user
